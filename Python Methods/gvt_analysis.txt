In a game of Goats vs. Trolls, each player chooses to
represent one of two possible factions: the heroic Goats,
or the villainous Trolls. The players draw cards from a
shuffled deck of 40 cards and place them into a hand. The
players take turns and use the cards in their hands to
attack the other player's cards until one player's score is
reduced to 0.
Each card in a game of GvT has several attributes
including:
● Name
● Resource cost
● Faction (Goats or Trolls)
● Rarity (legendary, rare, uncommon, or common)
● Attack power
● Health
